# piholespeedtesttomysql
pihole speedtest-cli tool logs to sqlite3. I dont like sqlite, i like mysql thus this repo

## why? 

I dont like sqlite3, also i would rather log to mysql db where know it better and also can graph it with grafana. You can do both if needed this is just a personal preference.
